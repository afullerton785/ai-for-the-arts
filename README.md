# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio
The repository is used to store components of a larger project together in a sort of 'folder'. 
By the end of this course I want to be able to:
- Become more familiar with the working of GitHub
- Understand more the various uses of generative AI within the arts and humanities
- Learn the dangers and risks that come with the use of generative AI.
